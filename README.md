# Google Photos - Fix dates and names
## google-photos-fix-dates-and-names
This little script will merge your .json files with your Image and Videofiles from Google Photos. It will only set the creation &amp; modified dates on the files by the information it will get from the json-file inside the same folder. You can also rename the buggy names it will sometimes get like IMG_5028.JPG (1).json instead of IMG_5028 (1).JPG.json
